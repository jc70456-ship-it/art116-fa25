		<h1 id="header1"> About our team</h1>

		<p id="p1">Our members have been growing up with playing toys that was made from the 50s to the 90s. It was part of their childhood memory, and wished it could live on to this day. However, as years go by, new toys, game consoles, and much more have been developing to something for the future generation. Although this brings cheer to the children, the crew have a thought of these children wanting to play with with toys or consoles from their time. This was then, the team began to build <b>Mice at Play!</b></p>
		<p id="p2">We the people at <b>Mice at Play</b> created an independent toy store for children to rekindle with nostalgic wonder with not only toys, but game consoles and boardgames. Not only the children can rediscover the poast, but their parents and us as well!</p>

		<h1 id="header2"> Our motivation</h1>

		<p id="p3">Our motivation to create this website and store is to let our children discover and play with toys we enjoyed in our time. As said before, we wish for not only the children to know, but the parents to rediscover as well.</p>
		<p id="p4">Although years has gone by, we still believe there is nostalgia in our current year, and wished for those to give it a try, especially for our young ones!</p>
